# Weather API with Redis Caching

## Project Description

This weather API fetches data from an external weather service, Visual Crossing, and then stores the results in memory cache (Redis) to speed up responses to repeated queries. This project demonstrates how to work with external APIs, use caching, and configure the environment in an ASP.NET Core application and is a Sample solution for the [weather-api](https://roadmap.sh/projects/weather-api-wrapper-service) challenge from [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/).

## Requirements

- .NET 6.0 or later
- Visual Crossing API Key (free API key)
- Redis (local installation,Docker container or Redid-insight)
